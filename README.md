# Temperature and Humidity tester with Comfort zone Indication

A simple device which goal was to tell its user the actual temperature and humidity of the enviroment. 
Also the display text saying something about temperature and humidity.

Device based on ATMEGA microcontroller, nokia 5110 display and the "power supply" was based on a few voltage regulators and 18650 Li-Ion battery for portability.

This project was just a 1-Day thing which Was created of pure boredom and from curosity how fast can I design, Etch a PCB and program a simple device.
It was never meant to be professional.
